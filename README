Stashmark

Is intended to be a personal bookmark manager.  For me, this will fill a void
that del.icio.us left.

After viewing Rick Olson's "Git: the stupid NOSQL database" presentation from
2010
(http://confreaks.net/videos/443-rubyconf2010-git-the-stupid-nosql-database?player=flash),
I decided to try and use git.  Alot of this work will be based on madrox
(https://github.com/technoweenie/madrox) and ideas from memory
(https://github.com/dm3/memory).  

The git persistance is handled by grit (https://github.com/mojombo/grit)

I really need this app so I can get rid of emails with links I sent to myself.
Here's hoping for inbox zero again.
